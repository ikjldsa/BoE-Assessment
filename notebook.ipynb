    "A Supervision Manager has asked you to help in allocating scarce resources, and identify which firms\n",
    "their team should focus on. Supervisory resource may be allocated according to the following\n",
    "characteristics:\n",
    "* Firm size (i.e. the biggest firms need more attention)\n",
    "* Changing business profile (are firms’ data changing substantially year-on-year?)\n",
    "* Outliers from the norm (when looking at a single reporting period, does a firm deviate significantly from the average?)Some typical metrics have been provided in the attached data sheets. These include:\n",
    "* Gross Written Premium (GWP) – total revenue written by an insurer. Equivalent of turnover for a non-insurance firm.\n",
    "* Net Written Premium (NWP) – GWP less reinsurance. NWP / GWP will show how much of the firm’s risk is being passed on to reinsurers.\n",
    "* SCR coverage ratio – a measure of whether a firm is meeting its prudential capital requirements. Greater than 100% means the firm is holding enough capital to meet the requirement. The size of the buffer (i.e. surplus over 100%) can be important.\n",
    "* Gross claims incurred – a large cost to an insurer. Monitoring how these change over timefor a firm is vital.\n",
    "* Net combined ratio – (incurred losses plus expenses) / earned premiums. This is a ratio that can indicate the profitability of a firm. If this is less than 100% it indicates a profit.\n",
    "# Task I\n",
    "Using the data provided, please analyse this data using a programming language of your choosing and produce a short report, including tables and charts, to highlight which firms should receive the most attention, according to the metrics above.\n",
    "# Task II\n",
    "Please consider using relevant ML techniques to draw out further insights and present them as an\n",
    "annex to your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Notes:\n",
    "* More metrics have been provided in the data than are necessary to include. Feel free to\n",
    "utilise these as you wish, but it is not necessary to use all metrics.\n",
    "* The data have been anonymised using a random multiplier. As such, there may be some\n",
    "unexpected patterns in the data. "
